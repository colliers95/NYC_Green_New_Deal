Dulles TES Tank for Internet Service Provider,Thermal Storage,Chilled Water Thermal Storage,Chilled Water Thermal Storage,Operational,"In 2006, a large Internet Service Provider (ISP) located in Dulles, VA selected DN Tanks to build a mission critical Thermal Energy Storage (TES) tank to service their data center. The data center which operates 24 hours each day could not afford the consequences that would result if their chilled water cooling system were to experience downtime. This TES tank, now our third built TES tank for this same ISP, was designed to provide back-up cooling for the central plant in the event that the chillers experience unexpected downtime.  The engineer for the project, Dunlap &amp;amp; Partners, designed the revisions to the chilled water system which included the addition of a new TES tank. The tank was specified to be capable of storing enough chilled water equal to the peak cooling load for the facility for a period of two hours. In addition, the chilled water pressure drop through the tank was specified to stay below 3 psi even in the event that the pumps were to require a delivery flow rater of 5,184 gpm which is the maximum flow rate to the building.  Poole &amp;amp; Kent, the mechanical contractor, provided the new chilled water piping, pumps, and valves in addition to overseeing the installation of this TES tank. DN Tanks together with Poole &amp;amp; Kent worked closely with the owner and engineers in ensuring that the TES system was constructed within the agreed upon schedule, and commissioned expeditiously so that the data center would be protected with this reservoir of chilled water.  In August of 2007, representatives of the owner, the mechanical contractor, the engineer, and DN Tanks commissioned the TES system. The commissioning process included shutting down all chillers during the middle of a weekday of the data center operation. Immediately upon shutting down the chillers, the new TES system was energized and chilled water from the TES tank became the sole source of cooling for the facility. The system remained in this mode for 1 hour and 40 minutes, while the TES tank operated flawlessly.",0,38.9624899,-77.44,,"Resiliency, ",Dulles,Virginia,United States,,DD.08.YYYY,,,PJM,,,,,0,,0,0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,

Hiwassee Dam,Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Operational,"Hiwassee Dam is a concrete gravity overflow dam 307 feet (94 m) high and 1,376 feet (419 m) long, and has a generating capacity of 185,000 kilowatts. The dam&#039;s spillway is controlled by seven radial gates, which, along with four regulating conduits at the bottom of the dam, give the dam a total maximum discharge of 112,000 cubic feet per second (3,200 m3/s). Hiwassee Lake stretches along the river for approximately 22 miles (35 km) to the town of Murphy, North Carolina, and has 180 miles (290 km) of shoreline, a storage capacity of 434,000 acre·ft (535,000 dam3) and 205,590 acre·ft (253,590 dam3) of flood storage. The reservoir&#039;s operating level varies by roughly 38 feet (12 m) in a typical year.  During the 1950s, TVA experimented with the idea of &quot;pumped storage&quot; at Hiwassee Dam. There it employed an energy-generating turbine that was run in reverse during low-demand hours to pump water below the dam into the upper reservoir. This integration of pump and turbine was the first of its kind in the United States; further, at the time it was the largest and most powerful in the world. The unit was built by Allis-Chalmers Company.

Cypress College TES Tank,Thermal Storage,Chilled Water Thermal Storage,Chilled Water Thermal Storage,Operational,"In 2016, Cypress College embarked on an ambitious project to expand their central plant which provides the cooling for the students, faculty, and staff of this 110 acre campus. As a part of the expansion of the central plant (built by PPC Mechanical Contractors), a new 890,000 gallon chilled water Thermal Energy Storage (TES) tank was designed and built by DN Tanks.  The performance criteria for the tank was specified by P2S Engineering and included a useable TES capacity of 10,000 ton-hours and a maximum chilled water flow rate of 2,400 gallons per minute. Integrated into the campus district cooling system, the tank provides cooling for the campus during the peak electric period of time during the afternoon, allowing the chiller equipment to de-energize during this time, which permanently reduces the campus’s electric demand. Utilizing the TES tank, the peak-demand electric load of the campus will be reduced by 1,100 kW’s.

Burbank Buena Vista Library #2 - Ice Energy,Thermal Storage,Ice Thermal Storage,Ice Thermal Storage,Operational,"Ice Energy’s flagship Ice Bear system enables a powerful change in how – and more importantly when – energy is consumed for air conditioning. The Ice Bear system is an intelligent distributed energy storage solution that works in conjunction with commercial direct-expansion (DX) air-conditioning systems, specifically the refrigerant-based, 4-20-ton packaged rooftop systems common to most small to mid-sized commercial buildings. The system stores energy at night, when electricity generation is cleaner, more efficient and less expensive, and delivers that energy during the peak of the day to provide cooling to the building. Daytime energy demand from air conditioning – typically 40-50% of a building’s electricity use during peak daytime hours – can be reduced significantly. In kilowatts, each Ice Bear delivers an average reduction of 12 kW of source equivalent peak demand for a minimum of 6 hours daily, shifting 72 kW-hours of on-peak energy to off-peak hours. Ice Bear units are typically owned by utilities and installed at distributed locations behind the customer meter on commercial and industrial sites. When aggregated and deployed at scale, a typical utility deployment will shift the operation of thousands of commercial AC condensing units from on-peak periods to off-peak periods, reducing electric system demand, improving electric system load factor, reducing electric system costs, and improving overall electric system efficiency and power quality.",8,34.1641362,-118.33,,"Electric Bill Management, Electric Supply Capacity, ",Burbank,California,United States,DD.03.YYYY,,,,N/A,Burbank Water &amp; Power,Public Owned,,Ice Energy,0,N/A,0,0,,,,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,

Seattle City Light Microgrid,Electro-chemical,Electro-chemical,Electro-chemical,Announced,"Seattle City Light will use a grant to help develop a microgrid, which will include a utility-scale battery system, solar panels and emergency generators located at a designated emergency shelter, such as a community center. During normal operations, the solar panels will charge the batteries and provide some of the power to operate the building. When the solar panels are not generating, the batteries can back up the delivery of electricity from Seattle City Light’s distribution grid or, during periods of high demand, could be used to reduce the amount of energy the utility has to purchase to meet customer needs, holding down costs for all its customer-owners. After a storm, earthquake or other emergency, the solar panels, emergency generators and battery system can power a portion of the building even if damage to the distribution grid causes outages in the surrounding area.  “Microgrids show promise for providing backup power during outages, increasing our community’s resiliency after a disaster and making it easier to integrate renewable energy resources, such as solar and wind,” comments Larry Weis, Seattle City Light’s general manager and CEO.

Daytime energy demand from air conditioning – typically 40-50% of a building’s electricity use during peak daytime hours – can be reduced significantly. In kilowatts, each Ice Bear delivers an average reduction of 12 kW of source equivalent peak demand for a minimum of 6 hours daily, shifting 72 kW-hours of on-peak energy to off-peak hours. Ice Bear units are typically owned by utilities and installed at distributed locations behind the customer meter on commercial and industrial sites. When aggregated and deployed at scale, a typical utility deployment will shift the operation of thousands of commercial AC condensing units from on-peak periods to off-peak periods, reducing electric system demand, improving electric system load factor, reducing electric system costs, and improving overall electric system efficiency and power quality.",8,34.1639544,-118.33,,"Electric Bill Management, Electric Supply Capacity, ",Burbank,California,United States,DD.03.YYYY,,,,N/A,Burbank Water &amp;amp; Power,Public Owned,,Ice Energy,0,N/A,0,0,,,DD.19.YYYY 23:19:36,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,

Alcatraz Island Microgrid ,Electro-chemical,Lead-acid Battery,Advanced Lead-acid Battery,Operational,"The US National Park Service, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, US Department of Energy and Princeton Power Systems collaborated to install a commercial scale Microgrid System on Alcatraz Island as a solution to high diesel fuel costs, pollution in the bay area, and high carbon emissions. When a ship’s anchor ruptured the underwater power lines in 1950, that linked the island to San Francisco, Alcatraz was forced to turn to diesel fuel and coal as its source of power. This has led to power costs of $0.76/kWh.   Microgrid Design:  This project reflects the National Park Service’s initiative to find an alternative way of powering the island in order to reduce fuel costs and pollution. A microgrid system, comprised of PPS inverters, a solar array, advanced lead-acid batteries, a PPS Site Controller, and back-up generators, was selected as a way to independently power the island. Designing and building the system on one of California’s and the U.S.’s most well-known historic landmarks with over 1 million visitors per year, created many challenges.   Component Placement: Preserving the island in pristine condition while completing the installation was the greatest challenge. Given that a system of this size requires a large construction effort, component placement was key. To prevent the solar array from being visible from San Francisco, it was placed on the roof of the prison in a flat configuration rather than a traditional angled configuration. The inverters, battery rack, and generators were placed in the old generator room, as this space is isolated and not accessible for tourists. The room was also protected from the harsh salt water environment.  Commissioning: The fragile natural environment and wildlife, particularly the birds (Alcatraz is an old Spanish word for pelican), added to the challenge. Extra attention was given to the solar panels after being damaged by rocks and shells dropped from overhead birds. Despite the coarse condition of the generator room, engineers were able to insulate the room to prevent future problems and ensure reliable long-term operation.",400,37.8269775,-122.42,,"Electric Supply Reserve Capacity - Non-Spinning, Microgrid Capability, Onsite Renewable Generation Shifting, Renewables Capacity Firming, ",San Francisco,California,United States,01.07.2012,30.07.2012,01.08.2012,,N/A,,,,,0,$0.71/kWh,3600000,0,,,DD.20.YYYY 23:20:35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
164 W. Magnolia - Ice Energy,Thermal Storage,Ice Thermal Storage,Ice Thermal Storage,Operational,"Ice Energy’s flagship Ice Bear system enables a powerful change in how – and more importantly when – energy is consumed for air conditioning. The Ice Bear system is an intelligent distributed energy storage solution that works in conjunction with commercial direct-expansion (DX) air-conditioning systems, specifically the refrigerant-based, 4-20-ton packaged rooftop systems common to most small to mid-sized commercial buildings. The system stores energy at night, when electricity generation is cleaner, more efficient and less expensive, and delivers that energy during the peak of the day to provide cooling to the building. Daytime energy demand from air conditioning – typically 40-50% of a building’s electricity use during peak daytime hours – can be reduced significantly.

Following testing at its Dolan Technology Center near Columbus, OH, the utility became the first U.S. electric company to deploy NaS batteries in 2002 when it installed and operated a 100 kW / 500 kVA demonstration unit in Gahanna, OH. In 2006, AEP installed a 1.2-MW stationary NaS battery near Charleston, WV. And in 2008, the utility installed three, 2 MW NaS batteries: one in Churubusco, IN.; one in Milton, WV; and one in Bluffton, OH. The 7.2 MW in NaS deployments are part of AEP’s electricity storage strategy that will also include transportable stationary batteries and distributed small scale energy storage systems.  AEP deployed all of its NaS installations as a means to provide load leveling and alleviate transformer loading during summer peaks, defer capital upgrades, and offer emergency backup power to several hundred customers during electrical system outages. Ultimately, the NaS units offer AEP a degree of flexibility in determining the optimal approach for handling reliability problems. The units buy the utility time to decide whether to redesign a substation, build generation, or keep the storage units in place permanently. (All of the NaS systems are capable of being relocated for an estimated $85,000 to $115,000 if and when the company’s needs for storage change.)  AEP’s 2-MW units were deployed in 2008, and are capable of providing islanding (backup power) for over seven hours when loss of utility power from the substation occurs. These newer installations can also perform load-triggered load leveling which, for example, allows the batteries to discharge just enough energy to hold a constrained substation transformer constant. As a result, a greater amount of energy can be reserved for islanding and battery life can be extended due to less frequent discharging.  AEP uses an in-house SCADA system and developed custom software to control all of its batteries based on the loading transformer. The software essentially creates a feedback loop where the load of the transformer is compared to a desired maximum, and the battery output is then adjusted to achieve that maximum.  In addition, the unit sited at the Balls Gap substation in Milton, WV successfully islanded approximately 700 customers for roughly 30 minutes during a simulated outage staged on July 8, 2009. A live islanding event, meanwhile, took place in December 2009, during a snowstorm that islanded 25 customers for two days. Over that period, the Milton installation was able to minimize disruptions; customers experienced less than three minutes of continuous disruption during the two-day outage period.  Finally, on October 20, 2009, the Milton, WV battery was successfully operated to alleviate load and voltage concerns during a load transfer event between substations. While the transformer at one station was taken out of service for maintenance, load was transferred to a different station which caused voltage and loading concerns. The Milton battery was deployed and mitigated these concerns.

Lewiston Pump-Generating Plant,Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Operational,"The Niagara project, located about 4 1/2 miles downstream from the Falls, consists of two main facilities: the Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant, with 13 turbines, and the Lewiston Pump-Generating Plant, with 12 pump-turbines. In between the two plants is a forebay capable of holding about 740 million gallons of water; behind the Lewiston plant, a 1,900-acre, 22 billion gallon reservoir holds additional supplies of this liquid fuel.  Water is diverted from the Niagara River—up to 375,000 gallons a second—and conveyed through conduits under the City of Niagara Falls to Lewiston. From there, water flowing through the Robert Moses plant spins turbines that power generators, converting this mechanical energy into electrical energy.  At night, when electricity demand is low, the Lewiston units operate as pumps, transporting water from the forebay up to the plant&#039;s reservoir.  During the daytime, when electricity use peaks, the Lewiston pumps are reversed and become generators, similar to those at the Moses plant. In this way, the water can be used to produce electricity twice, increasing production and efficiency.  To balance the need for power with a desire to preserve the beauty of Niagara Falls, the United States and Canada signed a treaty in 1950 that regulates the amount of water diverted for hydroelectricity production. On average, more than 200,000 cubic feet per second (cfs), or 1.5 million gallons of water a second, flow from Lake Erie into the Niagara River. The 1950 pact requires that at least 100,000 cfs of water spill over the Falls during the daylight hours in the tourist season, April through October.

By pumping back at night-time, the system maximizes the benefit to taxpayers because night-time electricity costs about a third less than day-time electricity (due to decreased power demand).  Starting about one hour after sunset, the designated generators are switched into pumpback mode. Once they reverse direction, these units pull water from below the Russell Dam (in the upper portion of Thurmond Lake) and pump it back upstream into Russell Lake. Then, the next day during peak power demands, electricity is generated by releasing that water back down into Thurmond Lake.",600000,34.025195,-82.59,,"Electric Energy Time Shift, Electric Supply Capacity, ",Richard B.

Salina Pumped Storage Project,Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Operational,"The Salina Pumped Storage Project is a 260-megawatt (MW) pumped-storage power station near Salina, Oklahoma. It is owned and operated by the Grand River Dam Authority (GRDA). Its construction was in response to growing power demands and a lack of dam sites on the Grand River. The first phase was completed in 1968 and the second in 1971. The upper reservoir for the power station is Lake W. R. Holway which was built on Saline Creek and the lower reservoir is Lake Hudson on the Grand River. During periods of lower power demand, water is pumped from Lake Hudson to Lake Holway and released back down through the pump-generators during periods of high energy demand.  The project was constructed in two stages:  Stage 1 consisted of building an earth and rock filled dam in Chimney Rock Hollow 185 feet (56 m) high, creating Chimney Rock Reservoir. A canal 1,850 feet (560 m) long led from the dam to a forebay structure that had openings for steel penstocks,each 14 feet (4.3 m) in diameter. Three penstocks led from the forebay to a powerhouse that housed three 64,000 horsepower pump-generators, with a total rated capacity of 130 megawatts. This stage was completed in 1968.  Stage 2 comprised building three more penstocks, extending the powerhouse and adding three more pump-generators, all identical to those installed in Stage 1. This doubled the facility&#039;s capacity to 260 mw. It was completed in 1971.  The SPSP is controlled remotely from the GRDA Energy Control Center at the Robert S.

JC Penney Headquarters - Calmac,Thermal Storage,Ice Thermal Storage,Ice Thermal Storage,Operational,"CALMAC’s technology has proven its versatility to reduce operating costs since the tanks were installed in 1991. However, today the energy landscape in Texas is vastly different from 25 years ago. JCPenney is currently faced with a ratcheted demand charge from its utility as well as coincident peak charge, which make up a large portion of the company’s monthly utility bill.  With the ratcheted demand pricing, the month with the highest energy usage sets the annual peak demand charge. In 2013, the annual peak demand charge was set in August at $37,479. The charge is ratcheted at 80 percent, which means that for the 11 months following August, JCPenney pays a demand charge of $29,983 (80 percent of $37,479). This applies unless a new peak demand is set, in which case the process starts over.   The other significant demand charge that JCPenney’s Headquarters incurs is called a Transmission Cost Recovery Factor, also known as a 4CP or coincident peak demand charge. The 4CP is determined by averaging a customer’s demand during the highest grid-wide peak hours of peak demand in each of the four summer months, June through September.

Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) Battery System,Electro-chemical,Lead-acid Battery,Lead-acid Battery,De-Commissioned,"The PREPA was a fully commercial battery system that was acquired for daily operation in a frequency control and spinning reserve mode for the island grid of Puerto Rico. The grid had ongoing stability issues, and routinely had frequency and voltage excursions that could only be controlled by aggressive load-shedding, unless new generation was added to provide regulation and stability. The choices for new generation included fast-acting combustion turbines or battery energy storage. PREPA&#039;s analysis showed that battery energy storage systems offered superior operational benefits due to their faster reaction times, both for frequency regulation and spinning reserve requirements.  The comparable slower response times of combustion turbines required more installed capacity, whereas the faster reaction time of a battery system meant that a much smaller battery could offer the same functionality as larger sizes of combustion turbines. Typically, battery systems can reach full operating power in less than 1 second, whereas mechanical systems such as combustion turbines need several seconds to minutes to reach their full power output. The seemingly small difference in reaction times translates into very large consequences for the stability of the electric grid, where events that lead to outages propagate within cycles, and a difference of 1 min translates to a complete blackout under some conditions. Thus, it was shown that battery systems were a more cost effective option compared to combustion turbines because a smaller battery could outperform a much larger block of combustion turbines. This is particularly applicable to an &quot;island&quot; system, where there is no interconnection with a neighboring system to balance the momentary shortage of generation resources during an operational contingency.  The PREPA battery was patterned after the BEWAG battery in application as well as battery type. Valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) batteries were commercially available by the time the PREPA battery project was started, but PREPA chose a flooded, flat-plate cell because it had a proven track record at BEWAG. However, once utility operations began in 1994, the battery was cycled more frequently than planned, which caused the battery to age more rapidly than expected. This use led to positive-plate growth, which caused cell / jar cracks, leaks, short circuits, and ultimately early battery failure.  PREPA made the decision in 2001 to repower, or replace, the battery. A tubular positive plate, flooded battery was selected, and the new battery was installed in mid-2004. Several problems occurred, however, and the system was taken out of service.",20000,18.3978052,-66.01,,"Electric Energy Time Shift, Electric Supply Reserve Capacity - Spinning, Frequency Regulation, Voltage Support, ",San Juan,Puerto Rico,United States,01.01.1989,01.11.1994,01.07.1992,01.12.1999,N/A,Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA),State/Municipal Owned,Primary Distribution,Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA),0,See Sandia&#039;s &quot;Lessons Learned&quot;: http://goo.gl/9YI8t6,20300000,0,,,DD.08.YYYY 00:08:27,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,

Halotechnics Advanced Molten Glass for Heat Transfer and Thermal Energy Storage,Thermal Storage,Heat Thermal Storage,Heat Thermal Storage,Operational,"Halotechnics is developing a high-temperature thermal energy storage system using a new thermal-storage and heat-transfer material: earth-abundant and low-melting-point molten glass. Heat storage materials are critical to the energy storage process. In solar thermal storage systems, heat can be stored in these materials during the day and released at night--when the sun is not out--to drive a turbine and produce electricity. In nuclear storage systems, heat can be stored in these materials at night and released to produce electricity during daytime peak-demand hours.   Halotechnics new thermal storage material targets a price that is potentially cheaper than the molten salt used in most commercial solar thermal storage systems today. It is also extremely stable at temperatures up to 1200°C--hundreds of degrees hotter than the highest temperature molten salt can handle. Being able to function at high temperatures will significantly increase the efficiency of turning heat into electricity. Halotechnics is developing a scalable system to pump, heat, store, and discharge the molten glass.

Ice Energy project at 950 Twin View Blvd,Thermal Storage,Ice Thermal Storage,Ice Thermal Storage,Operational,"Ice Energy’s flagship Ice Bear system enables a powerful change in how – and more importantly when – energy is consumed for air conditioning. The Ice Bear system is an intelligent distributed energy storage solution that works in conjunction with commercial direct-expansion (DX) air-conditioning systems, specifically the refrigerant-based, 4-20-ton packaged rooftop systems common to most small to mid-sized commercial buildings. The system stores energy at night, when electricity generation is cleaner, more efficient and less expensive, and delivers that energy during the peak of the day to provide cooling to the building. Daytime energy demand from air conditioning – typically 40-50% of a building’s electricity use during peak daytime hours – can be reduced significantly.

These are about three times larger than the residential units, but can be shared between five to ten homes.  SMUD will continue to run tests and gather data through September 2012, giving the utility a nine-month experimental period with the RES units and roughly a six-month period for the CES units. Although complete results will not be available until the end of the year, the researchers will present preliminary data on March 19, 2012, at the PV America conference in San Jose, California.  Technical Details 3 CES installations, each consisting of two 15 kW CES units in a common enclosure Each CES installation provides 30 kW of capacity with 34 kWh of usable energy storage from SAFT Li-Ion batteries Each CES installation is connected to the secondary of a 50 kVA pad mount transformer feeding approximately 9-12 homes They will be operated to help answer critical questions related to reliability, system architecture optimization, operational control The CES systems can be coordinated, in an aggregated fashion, as a single utility asset testing larger scale integration concepts The CES is monitored/controlled via a wireless communications interface which will report critical inverter and battery status.

PacifiCorp Castle Valley VRB,Electro-chemical,Flow Battery,Vanadium Redox Flow Battery,De-Commissioned,"PacifiCorp is a utility based in Portland, Oregon with operations in six Western states. The Castle Valley site was serviced by a 25 kV feeder over 85 miles long, with 209 miles of total line. The length of the feeder led to complaints of low reliability and power quality. In addition, the feeder could not supply any significant amount of new load without causing low voltage to existing customers. Traditional alternatives to add capacity and improve service in this area are costly and environmentally difficult, so that PacifiCorp has sought viable alternatives to meet these goals. The Castle Valley VRB System was built and commissioned for this purpose.  Vanadium redox flow batteries store energy in two electrolytes which are pumped from separate storage tanks across proton exchange membranes in the cell stacks, producing a DC current. The reaction is reversible, so that the battery can be charged and discharged repeatedly with high efficiency. The VRB-ESS™ at Castle Valley was built by VRB Power Systems of Vancouver, British Columbia. The system was sized to provide 250 kW for 8 hours, with a round-trip efficiency when fully operational of between 65% and 80%. The system incorporated a power converter which converts the DC power provided by the battery to AC power during discharge, and vice versa during recharge. The power converter was also capable of providing reactive power compensation and overload capability for short periods of time.

Ludington Pumped Storage,Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Operational,"The Ludington Pumped Storage Plant sits on a 1,000-acre site along the Lake Michigan shoreline. The plant was built between 1969-73 and is jointly owned by Consumers Energy and Detroit Edison, and operated by Consumers Energy. The plant contributes directly to local governments about $11 million in annual property taxes.  Revenue from plant operations, maintenance and overhauls also contribute significant sums to the local economy.  Local residents still refer to the plant as “The Project”.  One of the world’s biggest electric “batteries”, Ludington can provide energy at a moment’s notice. Its ability lies in its 27-billion gallon reservoir and a set of six turbines that drive electric generators.  Those same turbines double as giant water pumps to fill the reservoir with water from Lake Michigan. At night, when electric demand is low, Ludington’s reversible turbines pump water 363 feet uphill from Lake Michigan. The water is pumped through six large pipes, or “penstocks”, to the 842-acre reservoir. During the day, when electric demand is high, the reservoir releases water to flow downhill through the penstocks. The flowing water turns turbines and generators in the powerhouse to make electricity. The plant can generate up to 1,872 megawatts — enough electricity to serve a community of 1.4 million residential customers. The output is more than double the capacity of any single unit on Consumers Energy’s system. Ludington’s relatively simple technology enables the plant to respond quickly to the daily, weekly and seasonal highs and lows of Michigan’s energy demand. The plant also saves customers money by enabling Consumers Energy to avoid the expensive spot market when customer demand exceeds the capacity of the company’s baseload plants.  The immense size of Ludington and its six-unit design offers flexibility in balancing customer demand with electric output on a moment’s notice.   Consumers Energy and Detroit Edison announced an $800 million upgrade on February 7 2011.

The four-unit station began generating electricity in 1991, and is the largest hydroelectric station on the Duke Energy system. It is named for the two streams, Bad Creek and West Bad Creek, which were dammed to create the Bad Creek reservoir.  The Bad Creek facility utilizes two reservoirs (or lakes) to generate electricity: an upper reservoir and a lower reservoir. Water stored in an upper lake is released into underground power tunnels. The water rushes down the tunnels, driving huge turbines, which are underground at the base of a dam. The spinning turbines are connected to large generators, which produce the electricity. The water then flows through draft tubes into a lower lake.  A pumped-storage hydroelectric station uses the same water over and over again, making more efficient use of water resources. When demand for electricity is low, operators can refill the lake, as if they were “recharging” a battery. Using power from other generating stations, the generators act as electric motors spinning the huge turbines backward. This pumps water back up the power tunnels into the upper lake. Water is generally pumped back to the upper reservoir at night and on weekends.  With the reservoir at full-pond elevation and generating with all four units, Bad Creek can generate for 24 hours within its maximum 160’ drawdown.

New Waddell Dam&#039;s primary purpose is to store Colorado River water for CAP use. The dam also stores Agua Fria River runoff and provides flood protection by controlling river flows. The dam is located one-half mile downstream of historic Waddell Dam, which was built by the Maricopa Water District (MWD). The dam&#039;s reservoir, Lake Pleasant, also stores water for MWD irrigation.  In the winter, Colorado River water is pumped uphill from the CAP aqueduct into Lake Pleasant when power rates are low. In the summer, when demand for water and electricity increases, water is released through the Pump-Generating plant, producing hydroelectric power that is sold to help repay the CAP&#039;s construction costs. In addition, New Waddell Dam adds 7,000 surface acres to the lake, greatly increasing the recreational value of Lake Pleasant Regional Park.  Handicapped-accessible recreational facilities include 3 multiple-lane boat ramps, 450 picnic sites, 225 campsites, 14 group use areas, 4 overlooks, a full-service marina equipped to handle 1000 boats, and 7 miles of trail. Because the reservoir water level may fluctuate up to 125 feet during a typical year&#039;s operation, the facilities will be located to be accessible during both high and low water periods.  If necessary, floodwaters can be released from the dam through the river outlet works tunnel into the Agua Fria River immediately below the dam. If the reservoir&#039;s flood storage capacity is ever exceeded, water can also be released over spillways located west of the dam. This water would flow down Morgan City Wash and back to the Agua Fria River about one mile below the dam.  The cost of constructing New Waddell Dam was more than $625 million.

Due to passing clouds, solar energy output was observed to rapidly fluctuate; cases were observed where over 80% of a solar unit&#039;s output would drop in less than five seconds.  This rapid fluctuation in circuit power flows can cause undesirable voltage conditions that are significant for existing infrastructure to correct. To solve this, a battery system was envisioned that charged and discharged to absorb the solar-induced &quot;power swings&quot;, allowing the circuit&#039;s voltage profile to remain smooth despite significant and rapid changes to the power flows along it.   Duke has arranged 12 batteries manufactured by the Italian company FIAMM for use in series in hybrid electric buses to make a 402-kilowatt battery. It is used to smooth out large minute-by-minute spikes and troughs in production from the 1.2-megawatt rooftop solar project Duke operates about a mile away.  The Rankin project is designed to give Duke hard data on what would be the smallest battery that could be used to reduce these swings effectively.

Aquion’s final deliverable was an ~15 kWh system, dubbed an aqueous hybrid ion (AHI) battery, that has the ability to perform medium to long duration (&amp;gt; 2 hours) charge and discharge functions approaching 95% DC-DC efficiency.   The system has functioned, and continues to function as predicted with no indication that it will not tolerate well beyond 10 calendar years and 10,000 cycles. It has been in continuous operation for more than 1 year with 1,000 cycles (of varying depth of discharge, including 100% depth of discharge) and no identifiable degradation to the system. The final thick electrode cell structure has shown an energy density of 25 kWh/m3 at a five hour (or greater) discharge time. The primary chemistry has remained non-toxic, containing no acids or other corrosive chemicals, and the battery units have passed numerous safety tests, including flame resistance testing. These tests have verified the claim that the device is safe to use and contains no hazardous materials.  Current projections show costs at the pack level to offer best in class value and are competitive with lead-acid batteries, factoring in LCOE.  The final deliverable system for the DOE award was assembled in late 2011 and testing began shortly thereafter. This system consists of 270 Battery 0 units connected in series, with a footprint of 45 x 58 x 60 (LxWxH) and weighing approximately 2800 lbs.

Keys III Pump-Generating Plant (formerly known as Grand Coulee Pump-Generating Plant) pumps water uphill 280 feet from Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake to Banks Lake. This water is used to irrigate approximately 670,000 acres of farmland in the Columbia Basin Project. More than 60 crops are grown in the basin and distributed across the nation  Construction of the irrigation facilities began in 1948. Components of the project include the pump-generating plant, feeder canal, and equalizing reservoir, which was later named Banks Lake. Banks Lake was formed by damming the northern 27 miles of the Grand Coulee, and has an active storage capacity of 715,000 acre-feet. The lake stores water for irrigation and also provides important recreational benefits to the region. The pump-generating plant began operation in 1951. From 1951 to 1953, six pumping units, each rated at 65,000 horsepower and with a capacity to pump 1,600 cubic feet per second, were installed in the plant.   In the early 1960s, investigations revealed the potential for power generation. Reversible pumps were installed to allow water from Banks Lake to flow back through the units to generate power during periods of peak demand. The first three generating pumps came online in 1973. Two more generating pumps were installed in 1983; the final generating pump was installed in January 1984. The total generating capacity of the plant is now 314,000 kilowatts. In 2008, the pump-generating plant was renamed in honor of John W. Keys III.

Metlakatla BESS,Electro-chemical,Lead-acid Battery,Lead-acid Battery,Operational,"Metlakatla Power and Light (MP&amp;amp;L) has a BESS installation consisting of Exide (GNB Industrial Power) VRLA cells, providing rapid spinning reserve, frequency control, and better power quality. Beginning operation in 1997, the MP&amp;amp;L BESS has a 1 MW peak power output, and 1.4 MWh energy capacity. It is capable of supporting continuous loads of 800 kilovolt amperes (kVA), pulse loads up to 1200 kVA, and consists of 378 Absolyte VRLA 100A75 modules. Nearly 5 MW of hydroelectric generation capacity provides almost all of MP&amp;amp;L’s power, with a 3.3 MW diesel generation system relegated to reserve duty. MP&amp;amp;L’s two hydroelectric plants, Purple Lake and Chester Lake, have reservoir storage capacity, though the hydro generators were too slow to respond to sudden load fluctuations. At the time of the BESS’s initial operations, the MP&amp;amp;L peak load was approximately 4 MW. A lumber mill in Metlakatla (since closed down) caused large, sudden power spikes on the community’s islanded power system, and the BESS was installed to provide fast response for the mill’s rapid load changes.  The MP&amp;amp;L BESS is housed in a purpose-built 40-foot by 70-foot steel butler building that sits on a cement pad. Installation cost of the 1 MW / 1.4 MWh Exide Metlakatla BESS was $1.6 million in 1996 dollars (estimated cost in 2009 dollars: $2.2 million). The battery system became operational in February 1997. It operated continuously for 11.5 years until September 2008, when the battery was replaced with a new VRLA product. The VRLA battery exceeded its 8-year design life by over 3 years. The BESS is estimated to have saved MP&amp;amp;L over $6.5 million over its life in reduced fuel consumption and maintenance, in addition to reduced greenhouse emissions. A new battery was installed with the support of the Alaska Commerce, Community, and Economic Development Agency, so the BESS will continue to provide benefits to the community for many years to come.

The project is based at SCE’s Monolith Substation in Tehachapi, California and includes a 32 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) and the associated power conversion system. The project will evaluate the performance of the BESS to improve grid performance and assist in the integration of large-scale variable energy resourced generation. Project performance will be measured with 13 specific operational uses:   1. Provide voltage support and grid stabilization 2. Decrease transmission losses 3. Diminish congestion 4.  Increase system reliability  5. Defer transmission investment 6. Optimize size of new renewable-related transmission 7. Provide system capacity and resource adequacy 8. Integrate renewable energy (smoothing) 9. Shift wind generation output 10. Frequency regulation 11. Spin / non-spin replacement reserves 12. Ramp management 13. Energy price arbitrage.   Most of the operations either shift other generation resources to meet peak load and other electricity system needs with stored electricity, or resolve grid stability and capacity concerns that result from the interconnection of variable energy resources.
