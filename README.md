An R shiny project visualizing New York City's recently announced Green New Deal, specifically the impact it could have on different types of buildings and the different boroughs

Ultimate aim is to have a tab for each element of the bill, using available data to see which groups or people/buildings/zip codes may be disproportionally positively or negatively affected.
